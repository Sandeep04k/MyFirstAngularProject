            Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation of dynamic web applications. Examples of web applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon.</p>

                There are two broad divisions of web development – front-end development (also called client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development).

                Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application – the content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes – HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                
                HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for ‘marking up’ text in order to turn it into a web page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web application. CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the web. Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language that’s widely used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.
                
                Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end.</p>
